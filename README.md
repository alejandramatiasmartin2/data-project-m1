# Data project module 1
## Instructions
Data project module 1
In this project we are going to create a Data Pipeline that retrieves the following table:

| Country       | Job Title      | Gender | Quantity | Percentage |
| :-----------: |:-------------: | :-----:| :-------:| :---------:|
| Spain         | Data Scientist | Female | 25       | 5%         | 
| Spain         | Data Scientist | Male   | 25       | 5%         |


## Datasources

There are 3 different datasources involved:

Tables (.db). Here you can find the .db file with the main dataset.

API. We will use the API from the Open Skills Project.

Web Scraping. Finally, we will need to retrieve information about country codes from Eurostat website.


## Requirements

It must be contained in a GitHub repository which includes a README file that explains the aim and content of your code. You may follow the structure suggested here.

It must create, at least, a .csv file including the requested table. Alternatively, you may create an image, pdf, plot or any other output format that you may find convenient. You may also send your output by e-mail, upload it to a cloud repository, etc.

It must provide, at least, two options for the final user to select when executing: (1) To get the table for every country included in the dataset, (2) To get the table for a specific country imputed by the user.
